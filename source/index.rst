About **mmg**
*************

**mmg** is an open-source software for bidimensional and tridimensional
surface and volume remeshing. 
**mmg** source code is available on 
`github.com <https://github.com/MmgTools/mmg>`_.

It is compatible with most operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows).

**mmg** provides 3 applications and 4 libraries:
  * the **mmg2d** application and library: mesh generation from a set of 
    edges, adaptation and optimization of a bidimensional triangulation, and 
    isovalue discretization;
  * the **mmgs** application and library: adaptation and optimization of a 
    surface triangulation and isovalue discretization;
  * the **mmg3d** application and library: adaptation and optimization of a 
    tetrahedral mesh, isovalue discretization and lagrangian movement;
  * the **mmg** library gathering the **mmg2d**, **mmgs** and **mmg3d** 
    libraries.
